            <div>I am Nematullah Ghanizada from Afghanistan, who came to the USA in 2021. 
                When I arrived in the USA, I tried to follow my dream and learn what I couldnâ€™t learn in Afghanistan, so I started to learn Software Web Development as my passion and future life. Literally, it has been so hard to learn at first because of the English language. Bypassing a period now I can catch and understand better how to learn it and how to study in this field.
                This is my first project in Software Web Development in my entire career. I love to learn it.
